# Daily Code Snippets

A collection of small coding exercises, algorithm solutions, and handy code snippets I write daily. This repo serves as a personal practice log and reference for quick solutions.

## What’s Inside

- **Algorithms & Data Structures** – Daily problem-solving exercises.
- **Java / Python Snippets** – Reusable code blocks for common tasks.
- **Challenge Solutions** – Code from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and more.

## How to Use

Browse through the files to see solutions or reuse code snippets in your own projects. Each snippet is kept simple and self-contained.

## Contribution

This is mainly a personal practice repository, but suggestions and contributions are welcome.
